Here's my analysis of my breath data and patterns I've found in it.

I've used a Microlife Asthma Monitor to collect my data https://www.microlife.com/consumer-products/respiratory-care/asthma-monitor/pf-100

I've also used NOAA (National Centers for Environmental Information) to collect weather data https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2

This analysis is ongoing - I am still collecting data and finding new ways to analyze it.

The code is written in such a way that you can use it to analyze your own breath data

Requires Jupyter Notebook to run locally https://jupyter.org/install
